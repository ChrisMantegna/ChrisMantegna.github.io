Janauary is notorious for overly rigorous goal setting and mildly delusional levels of committment to brand new habits. In the spirit of consistency, I am going to small consistent actions to build strong workflows that will serve me well as I move forward. 

January Goals:
* R coding practice (non-project based) 17 times in January
* Completion of the Yellow Island website chronicling our 2022 work
* Literature review for WDFW mussel project
* Hall Conservation Grant application submission
